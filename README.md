## Capstone Project Introduction

In this age of Industry 4.0, industries are beginning to implement digital integration to boost their production efficiency. According to Anton Setiyawan, Director of Digital Economy Protection of Badan Siber dan Sandi Negara (BSSN) of Indonesia, there will be more Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem users than the number of smartphones users in Indonesia.
Currently, some of the fruit and vegetable industry in Indonesia are still lacking digital integration and automation for quality checks. By developing a Machine Learning model for fruit / vegetable quality classification in a mobile dashboard, we hope that this will be the first step for the development of IoT implementation in the fruit and vegetable industry, especially in Indonesia.
